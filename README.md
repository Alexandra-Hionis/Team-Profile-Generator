## Description
 A Node.js application that will build a software engineering team generator command line application. A Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
